# JavaFX-Solar-System-Game
this is a java eclipse project

This game was developed to help teach very young children to learn some aspects about our solar system. The game contains a list of planets which are displayed using graphics and using event handlers to controller a play which can be moved around, when the player hovers over each planet the name of that specific planet is then played in an audio worth, I think this is a good way to get young school children to learn the names of each planet and what they look like.
